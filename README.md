Final Project: Marathon race runners
User Story: A sports company has hired you to write an application that would simulate a marathon race between interesting groups of participants. They could be slow as a tortoise, as
fast as a hare, and anything in between. The runners differ in their speed and how often they need to rest. Some may be slow and never rest; others may run fast but lose steam quickly and rest a
lot of the time. Still others could be anything in between.

Example operation between two runners: A Tortoise and a Hare
• Say in this case, there are only two runners. The runners differ in their speed and how often they need to rest. One of the runners, named “Tortoise,” is slow but never rests. The other
runner, named “Hare,” is ten times as fast but rests 90% of the time.
• There is a random element to the runners’ performance, so the outcome of the race is different each time the application is run.
• The race is run over a course of 1000 meters. Each time one of the runners move, the application display the runner’s new position on the course. The first runner to reach 1000
wins the race.
• When one of the runners finishes the race, the application declares that runner to be the winner and the other runner concedes.

Each runner has following information:
RunnersName RunnersSpeed RestPercentage
Tortoise 10 0
Hare 100 90
Dog 50 40
Cat 30 75
The program accommodates N number of runners.
You will read the above runners information from an input source.

Runners Information: The runner’s information will come from one of the input sources.
Your program is capable of reading runners data from:
a. A text File
b. A XML file
c. A derby database (rdbms), or
d. Hard coded default data for two runners
